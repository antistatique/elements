# Toolbox Reader ðŸ‘“

## Install and run

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

## Concept

The idea is to **remove all the styleguide's related build processes and dependencies** from any project to keep them clean and simple. With this approach, a standard project will contain only his own build processes.

**The styleguide will be only visible using the bundle of the reader using CDN**. This offer a common, single and easy to maintain styelguide reader who will fits to all our project.

The data and the components will be defined aside of the reader; check `public/index.html`.
