# Toolbox Reader ğŸ‘“

## Install and run

Make sure you have the `/public` directory correctly set up before you start working on Toolbox Reader. Our recommendation is to start off another styleguide. When you're done, just run (replace `base-styleguide` by your base styleguide path:

```bash
ln -s `pwd`/../base-styleguide/build `pwd`/public
```

Then, to install and run Toolbox Reader locally:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
